        <h2>About Jumbo Josh</h2>
        <p>
            Jumbo Josh appears to be a lime, muscular giant creature, vaguely shaped like a humanoid with two stubby legs, two widening forearms ending with mitten-like fists, and a rather bulbous head. On his head, there are two bugged-out eyes and a mischievous tongue-less mouth shaped to a wide grin. Jumbo Josh is a strong creature who can get angry a lot; other than that, he's pretty chill. He shows hostility to humans.
